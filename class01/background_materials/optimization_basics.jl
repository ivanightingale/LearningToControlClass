## Prelude

Research and make sure you understand the following concepts/questions:
 - What is a convex maximization optimziation problem? and a minimization one? Why are convex problems desirable (compared to non-convex ones)?
 - What is a linear program?
 - What are Lagrangian multipliers?
 - What are Integer problems? and Mixed-Integer problems?
 - What is duality? Can you construct the dual of at least a linear program?

# Background – Modeling Optimization Problems in JuMP 🏗️

This short Pluto notebook walks you through three small optimisation models of increasing
difficulty:

1. **Linear program (LP)**
2. **Mixed‑integer linear program (MILP)**
3. **Non‑linear program (NLP)** – a taste of what shows up constantly in **optimal‑control** and simulaing **non‑linear systems**.

For every task you will:

* Write down the mathematical formulation.
* Translate it into a JuMP model.
* Solve it.
* Pluto will run tests to check your answer.
  When the tests are green ✅ you can be confident that your model is producing the expected answer.

## 1. Linear program – Production planning

A workshop makes **widgets** \(w\) and **gadgets** \(g\). The table below specifies how many machine--hours and human labour hours are required to produce each product and how much profit the company makes after selling the product.

|            | Machine‑-hours | Labour‑-hours | Profit (\$) |
|------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|

### 1.2 Other Modeling Tricks
#### Epigraph reformulation for absolute-value expressions  
A convex **epigraph** turns a non-linear term into a linear one by treating it
as the upper envelope of an auxiliary variable.

*Goal:* model $u \;\ge\; |x|$ (or set $u=|x|$ in an objective).

**Epigraph form**

```math
\begin{aligned}
u &\ge \phantom{-}x,\\[-2pt]
u &\ge         -x.
\end{aligned}
```

* Both constraints are linear, so $u$ is the **least upper bound** on $|x|$.
* If the objective minimises $u$ (or if $u$ appears on the left-hand side of
  other $\le$ constraints) the optimum forces $u=|x|$ automatically.
* No binaries are required – this is purely continuous and exploits the convex
  shape of $|x|$.

**Example** – Weighted-Median Warehouse Location on a Highway

A logistics company must decide where to build a single cross-dock hub along a straight 50-km stretch of highway.  
Eight supermarkets lie on the same axis at known kilometre posts $d_i$ and generate a daily demand (truck-loads) $w_i$.

| Supermarket $i$            | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |

Let $x \in [0,50]$ be the kilometre post chosen for the hub.  
Travel occurs on the highway, so distance is **one-dimensional**.  
Devise an optimization problem that minimizes the work done by the truck (distance times weight).

#### Cutting-plane (outer-approximation) method for nonlinear functions  
When a constraint contains a smooth convex function $g(x)\le 0$, one can
iteratively approximate it by linear cuts that **support** the graph of $g$.

**Idea**

1. **Relax** the nonlinear constraint and solve the LP/MILP master problem.
2. **Check** the candidate solution $\bar x$:
   * If $g(\bar x)\le0$ it is feasible (and the current best).
   * Otherwise, generate a tangent plane that cuts off $\bar x$ but remains
     valid for all feasible points (by convexity).

   The gradient $\nabla g(\bar x)$ gives the supporting hyperplane

```math
     g(\bar x) + \nabla g(\bar x)^{\!\top}(x-\bar x)\;\le\;0 .
```

3. **Add** this cut to the master problem and repeat.

Because each cut is a *global* under-estimator of $g$, the feasible region is
shrunk safely from the outside—hence *outer approximation*.  For a convex NLP
the procedure converges finitely to the exact optimum; for non-convex problems
it provides a lower bound similar to branch-and-cut.

*Common uses*

* **Piecewise-linearisation** of $\sqrt{\cdot},\;\log(\cdot),\;\exp(\cdot)$ or
  power losses in energy networks.
* **Benders-like** decomposition where cuts approximate a difficult sub-problem
  (e.g. chance-constraints, stochastic recourse).

---

Combined with the earlier tricks, epigraphs give **exact linear models** for
many convex terms, while cutting planes let you tackle the truly nonlinear bits
progressively, keeping the master problem linear and solver-friendly.

**Example** -- Cutting-plane Exercise – Approximating a Circular Constraint with Linear Cuts

A small drone must carry a **payload** of mass $m\,[\mathrm{kg}]$ and an
**on-board battery** of capacity $c\,[\mathrm{Ah}]$.
Because of fuselage geometry the two design variables must lie
*inside* a circular envelope in the $(m,c)$-plane:

```math
m^{2} + c^{2} \; \le \; 100 .
```

The engineering goal is to minimise the total cost

```math
\min\;  200\,m +  80\,c ,
```

subject to the circle above and simple bounds

```math
0 \;\le\; m \;\le\; 12, \qquad
0 \;\le\; c \;\le\; 12 .
```

Since the solver available to you handles only linear (M)ILPs, you will
replace the quadratic constraint by a sequence of cutting planes
(outer approximation).

**Cutting-plane algorithm outline**

1. **Master LP**  
   * Start with the bounding box only.  
   * Solve for a tentative point $(\bar m,\bar c)$.

2. **Feasibility check**  
   * If $\bar m^{2}+\bar c^{2} \le 100$ the point is feasible $\Rightarrow$ **done**.  
   * Otherwise generate a *supporting hyperplane* for the circle at $(\bar m,\bar c)$:

```math
2\,\bar m\,(m - \bar m) \;+\; 2\,\bar c\,(c - \bar c) \;\le\; 100 \;-\; \bar m^{2} \;-\; \bar c^{2}.
```

(Derived from the gradient of $g(m,c)=m^{2}+c^{2}-100$.)

3. **Add Cut**
    * Add cut & repeat.

At any point in the solution process, the current LP solution looks like (for a given set of cuts indexed by $j$):
```math
\begin{aligned}
\min_{m,c} \quad & 200\,m + 80\,c \\
\text{s.t.}\quad & 0 \le m \le 12, \\
                  & 0 \le c \le 12, \\
                  & 2\,\bar m_j\,(m - \bar m_j) + 2\,\bar c_j\,(c - \bar c_j) \le 100 - \bar m_j^{2} - \bar c_j^{2}, \quad j=1,\dots,J.
\end{aligned}
```

Your tasks

1. **Implement** the iterative procedure in JuMP + HiGHS:  
   - master model with variables `m`, `c`;  
   - a loop that solves, checks feasibility, and adds cuts when needed.  

2. **Record** and (optionally) plot the objective value after each iteration.

### 2.3 Other Modeling Tricks

Below are some classic “tricks of the trade’’ for turning non-linear or logical
requirements into **mixed-integer linear programming (MILP)** form.  
Throughout, $x\in\mathbb R^n$ are continuous decision variables and
$z\in\{0,1\}$ are binary (0–1) variables.

---

#### Big-$M$ linearisation of conditional constraints  
Suppose a constraint should apply **only if** a binary variable is 1:

```math
z = 1 \;\Longrightarrow\; a^\top x \le b.
```

Introduce a sufficiently large constant $M>0$ and write

```math
a^\top x \;\le\; b + M\,(1-z).
```

* If $z=1$ the right-hand side is $b$, so the original constraint is enforced.  
* If $z=0$ the bound is relaxed by $M$ and becomes non-binding.

> **Caveat:** pick $M$ as tight as possible. Over-large $M$ values hurt the LP
> relaxation and may cause numerical instability.

---

#### Indicator constraints (a safer alternative)  
Modern solvers allow *indicator* constraints that internally handle the
implication without an explicit $M$:

```math
z = 1 \;\Longrightarrow\; a^\top x \le b.
```

In JuMP:

```julia
@constraint(model, z --> a' * x <= b)
```

## 3. Non‑linear program – Modified Rosenbrock valley

Non‑linear models dominate **optimal control** because discretising the differential equations that
describe a physical system almost always yields a **non‑linear program (NLP)**.

Let's modify the classic (and benign) **Rosenbrock** function

```math
\begin{aligned}
\min_{x,\,y} \quad & f(x,y) \;=\; -(1-x)^{2} + 100\,(y - x^{2})^{2} + 10000x \\
\text{s.t.}\quad  & -10 \le x \le 10,\\
                  & -60 \le y \le 60.
\end{aligned}
```

It has a single global minimum within the feasible reagion defined by the box constraints on $x$ and $y$.

distances to the two foci is _no greater_ than $2a$**.  
Formulate these three nonlinear constraints and use **Ipopt** to locate the optimal
$(x^*,y^*)$ and corresponding objective value.

1. Implement the model with the three ellipse constraints.  
2. Solve it and report the optimal point and objective.  
3. Verify that the solver stopped at a feasible point (all three distance sums $\le 2a$).

## Why non‑linear models matter in optimal control 🚀

When you discretise a continuous‑time optimal‑control problem (for example with **direct collocation**)
you obtain an optimisation problem whose variables are the states, controls, and possibly parameters
at many discrete time points:

```math
\begin{aligned}
&\min_{x_{k},u_{k}} && \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \; \ell(x_{k},u_{k}) \\
&\text{s.t.} && x_{k+1} = x_{k} + h\,f(x_{k},u_{k}), \qquad k=0,\dots,N-1, \\
& && g(x_{k},u_{k}) \le 0, \\
& && x_{0}=x_{\text{init}}, \; x_{N}=x_{\text{goal}}.
\end{aligned}
```

Even when \(f\) and \(g\) are **polynomial** the resulting constraints are *non‑linear* in the decision variables.
Hence your optimisation solver must tackle *general NLPs*.  
Getting comfortable with modelling and debugging small nonlinear examples like Rosenbrock will pay off
when you step up to thousands of variables in real control problems!
